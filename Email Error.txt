When I try to use GMail SMTP for sending email via Laravel, I encounter the following error:

Swift_TransportException

Connection could not be established with host smtp.gmail.com [Connection timed out #110]




I had the same problem and I resolved it in this way:

'driver' => 'sendmail',

You need to change only that line.
